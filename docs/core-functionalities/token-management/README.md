# Token Management

Accessible from the left-side menu, the 'Token Management' section provides a set of tools for managing digital assets. This section is designed for Asset Managers to create, adjust, distribute, and control access to tokens on the Stellar network.

## Key Features

[token-creation.md](token-creation.md "mention")**:** This feature offers a straightforward flow for creating diverse assets, such as utility tokens, payment tokens, and more. Users can define core aspects of each token, including its profile, characteristics, and control mechanisms. The process also allows for setting the initial supply, enabling immediate minting post-creation. The intuitive design of this tool ensures that users can easily create tokens that align with their specific needs and goals.



[supply-management.md](supply-management.md "mention")**:** Asset Managers have the flexibility to adjust the token supply in real-time. This includes capabilities for minting new tokens or burning existing ones, providing dynamic control over the token's circulation. This feature is essential for responding to market demands or strategic adjustments in the token's economics.



[distribution.md](distribution.md "mention")**:** The Distribution tool simplifies the process of allocating tokens. It allows for seamless distribution of tokens to both internal vaults within the platform and external Stellar accounts. This feature is particularly useful for managing a wide range of transactional scenarios, ensuring efficient and controlled dissemination of tokens to the markets.



[access-control.md](access-control.md "mention")**:** In line with Stellar's control mechanisms, the 'Token Management' area allows users to manage interactions with their tokens effectively. It enables the setting of Stellar's control mechanisms, such as authorization required, freeze, and clawback, to regulate token transactions. This is essential for ensuring that actions like transfers or trades are authorized as well as KYC processes are followed before allowing an account to transact with the token, upholding the security and integrity of assets on the network.
