# Distribution

Distribution in the Stellar Asset Issuance Sandbox is done by sending a specific amount from the balance of the Main Vault account to other registered vaults, granting Asset Managers the ability to strategically allocate tokens across various accounts within the Stellar Network. This can be done through sales, rewards, or airdrops, enabling tokens to be spread out and utilized in the ecosystem.&#x20;

## Accessing Distribution

To access the Distribution page, navigate to the 'Distribution' section from the left-side menu. Ensure that you are logged in using an account with the necessary permissions for this section. Access to this tab is restricted exclusively to asset managers, reinforcing the security measures in place for the distribution of tokens.

In the distribution interface, Asset Managers can select a destination from a list of vaults capable of receiving the token, and specify the amount they want to send. If you want details about the vaults, head over to the [Treasury](../treasury.md) section.

The distribution amount is taken from the Main Vault account balance, so it's important to ensure that the chosen value is either equal to or less than the current balance.  If a higher amount is needed, managers can mint additional tokens for the Main Vault. Check the [Minting Supply](supply-management.md#minting-supply) section to find out more.

It is also possible to check on the page how much of the asset is currently available in the main vault compared to the entire circulating supply. It serves as a reference when distributing tokens from the main vault to other vaults or accounts.
